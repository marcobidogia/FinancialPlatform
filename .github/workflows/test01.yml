# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "dev" ] 
    tags:
      - 'v*' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "dev" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
